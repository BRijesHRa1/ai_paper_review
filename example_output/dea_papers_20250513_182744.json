    "abstract": "Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) with large actuation strain and high energy density are highly desirable for actuating soft robots. However, DEAs usually require high driving electric fields (>100 MV m−1) to achieve high performances due to the low dielectric constant and high stiffness of dielectric elastomers (DEs). Here, we introduce polar fluorinated groups and nanodomains aggregated by long alkyl side chains into DE design, simultaneously endowing DE with a high dielectric constant and desirable modulus. Our DE exhibits a maximum area strain of 253% at a low driving electric field of 46 MV m−1. Notably, it achieves an ultrahigh specific energy of 225 J kg−1 at only‍‌ ‌‌40‍‌ MV m−1, around 6 times higher than natural muscle and twice higher than the state-of-the-art DE. Using our DE, soft robots reach an ultrafast running speed of 20.6 BL s−1, 60 times higher than that of commercial VHB 4910, representing the fastest DEA-driven soft robots ever reported.",

    "abstract": "Dielectric elastomers, used as driver modules, require high power density to enable fast movement and efficient work of soft robots. Polyacrylate elastomers usually suffer from low power density under low electric fields due to limited response frequency. Here, we propose a bimodal network polyacrylate dielectric elastomer which breaks the intrinsic coupling relationship between dielectric and mechanical properties, featuring relatively high dielectric constant, low Young’s modulus, and wide driving frequency bandwidth (~200 Hz) like silicones. Therefore, an ultrahigh power density (154 W kg−1@20 MV m−1, 200 Hz) is realized at low electric field and high resonance frequency, 75 times greater than at 10 Hz. Further, a rotary motor is developed, reaching an impressive speed of 1245 rpm at 19.6 MV m−1 and 125 Hz, surpassing previous acrylate-based motors and entering the high-speed domain of silicone-based motors. These findings offer a versatile strategy to fabricate high-power-density dielectric elastomers for low-electric-field soft actuators.",
